### Khoj Chat
#### Overview
- Creates a personal assistant for you to inquire and engage with your notes
- You can choose to use Online or Offline Chat depending on your requirements
- Supports multi-turn conversations with the relevant notes for context
- Shows reference notes used to generate a response

### Setup
#### Offline Chat
Offline chat stays completely private and works without internet. But it is slower, lower quality and more compute intensive.

> **System Requirements**:
>  - You need at least **16 GB of RAM** and **4 GB of Disk**
>  - A CPU supporting [AVX or AVX2 instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) is required
>  - A Mac M1+ or [Vulcan supported GPU](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/) should significantly speed up chat response times

- Open your [Khoj settings](http://localhost:42110/config/) and click *Enable* on the Offline Chat card

#### Online Chat
Online chat requires internet to use ChatGPT but is faster, higher quality and less compute intensive.
